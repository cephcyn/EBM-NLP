## EBM-NLP ##

This corpus release contains 4,993 abstracts annotated with (**P**)articipants, (**I**)nterventions, and (**O**)utcomes. Training labels are sourced from AMT workers and aggregated to reduce noise. Test labels are collected from medical professionals. A sample annotated document looks like:

Full annotations are available in `ebm_nlp_*.tar.gz`, which are organized as follows.

* `documents/`
  Documents are labeled by their PubMed identification number (PMID). Each document has two files:
    * `documents/{PMID}.txt` Raw text of the abstract
    * `documents/{PMID}.tokens` Tokenized text to which the labels are assigned
    * `documents/{PMID}.pos` POS tags of each of the tokens

* `annotations/{aggregated|individual}/`
  Since each document is multiply-annotated, we present two versions of the data:
    * `aggregated` **Recommended** - One set of labels per document derived from a voting strategy.
    * `individual` All labels from each worker (multiply-annotated documents, noisy)

* `.../{starting_spans|hierarchical_labels}/`

  * `starting_spans/` Labels for **P/I/O** text spans
  * `hierarchical_labels/` Detailed labels for each starting span

* `.../{participants|interventions|outcomes}/`
  Labels for each **P/I/O** element are separated since they occasionally overlap (for 3% of tokens). An example of combining them for joint learning can be found in https://github.com/bepnye/EBM-NLP/tree/master/models/lstm-crf 

The label mappings for each PIO element are:

| label | **P** | **I** | **O** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | No label | No label | No label
| 1 | Age | Surgical | Physical
| 2 | Sex | Physical | Pain
| 3 | Sample size | Drug | Mortality
| 4 | Condition | Educational | Adverse effects
| 5 |  | Psychological | Mental
| 6 |  | Other | Other
| 7 |  | Control |
